# ClassLens-Daily-Student-Performance-Tracker
Student tool to track learning each day. Upload a simple CSV to see who was present (P/A), how each student scored on daily quiz questions (Yes/No), and their 1â€“5 feedback rating. View class summaries and drill down to any student to spot strengths, gaps, and trends. Works even when some days have one test and others have two. No coding needed.
